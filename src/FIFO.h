/**
 * Generic FIFO buffer Implementation.
 * 
 * Source code for the implementation of a FIFO buffer. The fifo can contain any
 * type of data, including but not limited to: integers, floats, structures,
 * arrays, etc.
 * 
 * This data structure can be used on a variety of situations, for example:
 * It can be used with microcontroller peripherals for buffering, as a message
 * or event queue, can be used for task synchronization or comunications 
 * and more.
